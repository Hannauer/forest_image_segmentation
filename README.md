Abstratc: The main project goal is to use image segmentation in order to produce segments of forest images based on google maps aerial images. We intend to gather images byeb scraping or to find some public API that has available aeriel images of forests. The expect result is that each different segment as dense forest areas, rivers and trails appearing on the image coul be able to be identified.
